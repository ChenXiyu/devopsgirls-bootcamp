# DevOpsGirls Bootcamp

In this repository are the slides and content for DevOpsGirls project held and run REA here in Melbourne.

## What you'll need:

To participate in DevOpsGirls, you will need:

 - A working laptop (OSX or Windows)
 - An AWS Free Tier account, if possible
 - If using Windows, an SSH client like [Putty.](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)

## Practicals

DevOpsGirls Bootcamp is run from two different approaches:

1. Console / Web Interface 
2. CLI (Advanced)


Console / Web Interface will cover off the following modules:


1.) [What are EC2 instances?](https://github.com/DevOpsGirls/devopsgirls-bootcamp/blob/master/1-1-EC2.md)

2.) [What is an ELB?](https://github.com/DevOpsGirls/devopsgirls-bootcamp/blob/master/2-1-ELB.md)

3.) [How do I automate this with Autoscaling Groups?](https://github.com/DevOpsGirls/devopsgirls-bootcamp/blob/master/3-1-ASG.md)


CLI

1.) [Creating a AWS Accoun]t
2.) [IAM]
3:) [AWSCLI Tooling to create EC2 intances, Autoscaling Groups and installation of Wordpress]
4.) [CloudFormation]


Each of the modules represents a continuining improvement on a blog website - a blog that you can login to, and post things in. With each module, we're making the blog more automated, more resilient, and more durable to issues.

If you run into anything, just give your coaches a shout - we'll be happy to help you.

Good luck!
