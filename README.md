# DevOpsGirls Bootcamp

In this repository are the slides and content for the DevOpsGirls project, to be held in February 4th in Melbourne, Victoria.

## What you'll need:

To participate in DevOpsGirls, you will need:

 - A working laptop
 - An AWS Free Tier account, if possible
 - If using Windows, an SSH client like [Putty.](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)

## Practicals

DevOpsGirls Bootcamp is composed of four different modules:

1.) [What is DevOps and AWS?](https://github.com/DevOpsGirls/devopsgirls-bootcamp/blob/master/1-1-DevOps.md)

2.) [What are EC2 instances?](https://github.com/DevOpsGirls/devopsgirls-bootcamp/blob/master/1-1-EC2.md)

3.) [What is an ELB?](https://github.com/DevOpsGirls/devopsgirls-bootcamp/blob/master/1-2-ELB.md)

4.) [How do I automate this with Autoscaling Groups?](https://github.com/DevOpsGirls/devopsgirls-bootcamp/blob/master/2-1-ASG.md)

Each of the modules represents a continuining improvement on a blog website - a blog that you can login to, and post things in. With each module, we're making the blog more automated, more resilient, and more durable to issues.

Good luck!
